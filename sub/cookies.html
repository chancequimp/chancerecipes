    <p>Who doesn't love a good cookie? But in order to create a proper cookie, you have to know the history of the cookie! I read online that some Persian guy stuck some nuts, honey, and spices together and invented the cookie. But I also read that some medieval European lady mixed some flour, sugar, and more spices together to create the cookie. Regardless of where these stories go, people create cookies out of the carnal desire for a sweet treat. The moral of the story here is, find your cookie. It doesn't even have to be a cookie. But if you're not here for abstracts and here for an actual cookie recipe, <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/15482/white-chocolate-chip-oatmeal-cookies/">here's</a> a recipe that I thought looked good.</p>

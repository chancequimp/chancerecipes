    <p>Can you tell that I ran out of ideas? I'm kidding. This is my best recipe yet. Actually, I can't call it mine. After all, it's the universe's recipe. It exists in all 3 states all across the cosmos, and not to mention, that some of our ancestors were so smart they thought to breathe and drink the stuff. Anyways, obviously you know about water. Which means you already know where and how to get water. Which means that this is page is useless.</p>
